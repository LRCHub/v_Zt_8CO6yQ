I go with you
We rise and dance, dance, dance (Haha)

Night so dark but I got the glow
Never be in danger
Take my hand, won't be alone
Light it up together
Heading to the top
Going so fast, when the beat speeds up
Don't look back, yeah, we know what's up
On your mark, ready, get, set, go

And you know, rain or snow makes it hard some days
But your heart will lead you toward
What your soul is searching for
Ups and downs, stormy clouds, we'll defy it all
We're just invincible
Come on in, me and my best friends

Wait, before we go
Don't forget my favorite bow
Strong but super sweet
That's our kind of kawaii
No matter, past or next, we'll seal it with one kiss
This isn't a dream anymore

That's how we do (Hey)
We rise and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha, twenty-four-seven
I go with you (Hey)
We rise and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha

Been thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (Ooh, ah, ah)
'Bout you and me, all night long
Ticking back the clock
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha
Been thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (Ooh, ah, ah)
'Bout you and me, all night long
Ticking back the clock
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha

Even after we disappear someday
Our melody will never fade away
Heading to the top
Goin' so fast when the beat speeds up
Don't look back, yeah, we know what's up, now we're bold
To the end, me and my best friends

Having fun is our mission
Pretty, funny, ambitious (—tious)
Nothing can beat my smile
Better when the world goes wild (Wild)
No clue what comes next, greet it with a lovely kiss
So with my melody, let's go

That's how we do (Hey)
We rise and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha, twenty-four-seven
I go with you (Hey)
We rise and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha

Been thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (Ooh, ah, ah)
'Bout you and me, all night long
Ticking back the clock
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha
Been thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (Ooh, ah, ah)
'Bout you and me, all night long
Ticking back the clock
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha

I go with you
We rise and dance, dance, dance

That's how we do (Hey)
We rise and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha, twenty-four-seven
I go with you (Hey)
We rise and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know
Twenty-four-seven, I gotcha
