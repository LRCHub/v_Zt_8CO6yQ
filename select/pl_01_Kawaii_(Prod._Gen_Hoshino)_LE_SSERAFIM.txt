Night so dark but I got the glow
Never be in danger
Take my hand, won't be alone
Light it up together
Heading to the top
Going so fast,
when the beat speeds up
Don't look back,
yeah we know what's up
On your mark
Ready get set go
And you know, rain or snow
Makes it hard some days
But your heart
will lead you toward
What your soul is searching for
Ups and downs, stormy clouds
We'll defy it all
We're just invincible
Come on in,
me and my best friends
Wait before we go
Don't forget my favorite bow
Strong but super sweet
That's our kind of kawaii
No matter past or next
We'll seal it with one kiss
This isn't a dream anymore
That's how we do
We rise and dance dance dance
Cause you know
24/7 I gotcha
24/7 I go with you
We rise and dance dance dance
Cause you know
24/7 I gotcha
24/7 I gotcha
Been thinkin' thinkin' non stop
Bout you and me all night long
Ticking back the clock
24/7 I gotcha
Been thinkin' thinkin' non stop
Bout you and me all night long
Ticking back the clock
24/7 I gotcha
Even after we disappear someday
Our melody will never fade away
Heading to the top
Goin' so fast
when the beat speeds up
Don't look back,
yeah we know what's up
Now we're bold
To the end,
me and my best friends
Having fun is our mission
Pretty funny ambitious
Nothing can beat my smile
Better when the world goes wild
No clue what comes next
Greet it with a lovely kiss
So, with my melody, let's go
That's how we do
We rise and dance dance dance
Cause you know
24/7 I gotcha
24/7 I go with you
We rise and dance dance dance
Cause you know
24/7 I gotcha
24/7 I gotcha
Been thinkin' thinkin' non stop
Bout you and me all night long
Ticking back the clock
24/7 I gotcha
Been thinkin' thinkin' non stop
Bout you and me all night long
Ticking back the clock
24/7 I gotcha
That's how we do
We rise and dance, dance, dance
Cause you know
24/7 I gotcha
24/7 I go with you
We rise and dance dance dance
Cause you know
24/7 I gotcha
24/7 I gotcha
Been thinkin' thinkin' non stop
Bout you and me all night long
Ticking back the clock
24/7 I gotcha
Been thinkin' thinkin' non stop
Bout you and me all night long
Ticking back the clock
24/7 I gotcha
