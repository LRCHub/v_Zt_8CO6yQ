[00:06.97] I go with you
[00:08.87] We rise, and dance, dance, dance (ha-ha)
[00:28.87] 
[00:15.15] Night so dark, but I got the glow, never be in danger
[00:18.86] Take my hand, won't be alone, light it up together
[00:22.66] Heading to the top, going so fast when the beat speeds up
[00:25.95] Don't look back, yeah, we know what's up
[00:27.86] On your mark, ready, get set, go
[00:29.72] And you know, rain or snow makes it hard some days
[00:33.40] But your heart will lead you toward what your soul is searching for
[00:37.23] Ups and downs, stormy clouds, we'll defy it all
[00:40.85] We're just invincible (come on in, me and my best friends)
[00:45.14] Wait, before we go, don't forget my favorite bow
[00:48.88] Strong but super sweet, that's our kind of kawaii
[00:52.63] No matter, past or next, we'll seal it with one kiss
[00:56.52] This isn't a dream anymore
[00:59.04] That's how we do (hey)
[01:01.30] We rise, and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know 24-7, I gotcha, 24-7
[01:06.89] I go with you (hey)
[01:08.87] We rise, and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know 24-7, I gotcha
[01:13.22] 24-7, I gotcha
[01:15.23] Been (been) thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (non-stop), 'bout you and me, all night long
[01:19.52] Ticking back the clock, 24-7, I gotcha
[01:22.61] Been (been) thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (non-stop), 'bout you and me, all night long
[01:27.29] Ticking back the clock, 24-7, I gotcha
[01:46.29] 
[01:32.41] Even after we disappear someday
[01:36.13] Our melody will never fade away
[01:39.57] Heading to the top, goin' so fast when the beat speeds up
[01:42.85] Don't look back, yeah, we know what's up, now we're bold
[01:45.32] (To the end, me and my best friends)
[01:47.22] Having fun is our mission, pretty, funny, ambitious ('tious)
[01:51.28] Nothing can beat my smile, better when the world goes wild (wild)
[01:54.49] No clue what comes next, greet it with a lovely kiss
[01:58.20] So, with my melody, let's go
[02:00.83] That's how we do (hey)
[02:03.26] We rise, and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know, 24-7, I gotcha, 24-7
[02:08.96] I go with you (hey)
[02:10.89] We rise, and dance, dance, dance, 'cause you know, 24-7, I gotcha
[02:15.12] 24-7, I gotcha
[02:17.08] Been (been) thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (non-stop), 'bout you and me, all night long
[02:21.58] Ticking back the clock, 24-7, I gotcha
[02:24.67] Been (been) thinkin', thinkin' non-stop (non-stop), 'bout you and me, all night long
